Introduction to Python for Statistical Learning

The first session in our statistical learning in Python series will briefly touch on some of the core components of Python's scientific computing stack that we will use extensively later in the course. We will not only introduce two important libraries for data wrangling, numpy and pandas, but also show how to create plots using matplotlib. Please note that this is not a thorough introduction to these libraries; instead, we would like to point out what basic functionality they provide and how they differ from their counterparts in R.

But before we get into the details we will briefly describe how to setup a Python environment and what packages you need to install in order to run the code examples in this notebook.
